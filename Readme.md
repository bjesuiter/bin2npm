# bin2npm

A helper cli which takes one or more binaries for different platforms and wraps them into an npm package for distribution.

## Installation via deno

1. Install from JSR
   `deno install --global --allow-read='.' --allow-write='.' -n bin2npm jsr:@bjesuiter/bin2npm`

## Installation via npm

Package URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bin2npm

Global Installation: `npm i -g bin2npm`
Local Installation: `npm i -D bin2npm`

## Installation via bun

Package URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bin2npm

Global Installation: `bun i -g bin2npm`
Local Installation: `bun i -D bin2npm`

## Usage (for all: deno, npm & bun)

1. Write a config file (see: example config file)
2. Run `bin2npm` => It will search for all bin2npm.toml files inside your CWD
3. Finished! If your config was correct, then your output npm package should be in your configured output dir!

## Example Config

```toml
# File: bin2npm.toml
bin2NpmVersion = "0"
outDir         = "npm"

[targetPackageJson]
    name        = "bin2npm"
    version     = "0.0.6"
    description = "A cli tool by @bjesuiter which takes one or more binaries for different platforms and wraps them into an npm package for distribution. Can also be used via bin2npm package on npmjs.org"

[[binaries]]
    # path to the binary you want to wrap, based on the cwd where you run bin2npm
    path = "compiled/bin2npm_linux_x64"
    # platform should be one of nodejs's os.platform() values:
    # for Node 16 LTS: 'aix', 'darwin', 'freebsd','linux', 'openbsd', 'sunos', and 'win32'
    # see https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/os.html#osplatform
    # These are only the allowed values. You have to provide the correct binary for this to work.
    platform = "linux"
    # arch should be one of nodejs's os.arch() values:
    # for Node 16 LTS: 'arm', 'arm64', 'ia32', 'mips', 'mipsel', 'ppc', 'ppc64', 's390', 's390x', and 'x64'
    # see https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/os.html#osarch
    # These are only the allowed values. You have to provide the correct binary for this to work.
    arch = "x64"

[[binaries]]
    path     = "compiled/bin2npm_macos_x64"
    platform = "darwin"
    arch     = "x64"

[[binaries]]
    path     = "compiled/bin2npm_macos_arm"
    platform = "darwin"
    arch     = "arm64"

[[binaries]]
    path     = "compiled/bin2npm_windows_x64.exe"
    platform = "win32"
    arch     = "x64"

# copy extra files from the current directory into the npm package
[[extraAssets]]
    from = "Readme.md"
    to   = "Readme.md"

# Dev Docs

## Asset building for compilation

Use `asset-builder` from (https://jsr.io/@codemonument/asset-builder) to have the template folder available to the deno cli.
Run `deno task pack-assets` to pack the files in `/template` into `src/gen/assets.ts`
Must be used in the npm AND the deno variant of this package, otherwise this cli will not work when installed from jsr.io!

## Releasing a new version (for JSR and npm)

1. Increase versions:
   1. In `cli.ts` for the bin2npm cli --version command
   2. In `deno.jsonc` for the JSR deployment of this package
   3. Of target npm package by updating the version in `./bin2npm.toml`
   4. In Changelog here at the bottom of the readme
2. Run `deno task pack-assets`
3. Commit all changes
4. Add a new git tag for your new version and push it => will trigger the deploy-npm.yml github workflow and the publish-jsr workflow

#### For deploying manually, run

1.  `deno task compile` to compile the deno scripts with the deno executable into self-contained executables
2.  `deno task assemble-npm` => This runs bin2npm on the compiled output of itself! (Great, isn't it?!?)
3.  `deno task publish-npm` to publish on npm
